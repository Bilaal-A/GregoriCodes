//DO NOT SCROLL DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!

//Seriously please do not scroll down to look at the programming and cheat. I spent way too long trying to find a system that lets you guys get these codes easily without downloading stuff. This was my best option. I tried to make a jar file, I tried replit, I tried github, and a bunch of other websites and techniques. I bloody ran out of 2 different free chatGPT account limits looking for a good solution. This was literally my last resort or else I'd have to completely restructure the game. All you gotta do here is click run, then input the codes you have. Please do not scroll down and ruin the game for everyone.

//DO NOT LOOK PAST THIS POINT PLEASE













//Seriously, please stop scrolling down. Don't ruin the game we worked so hard to create. Por favor.


















//Damn it dude, why did you have to cheat! Was it really worth it? Ruining all of mine and Owen's preparation just to cheat at a little game we made for our friends?
